function QL_PARAM = QL_parameters_constants()
% QL_PARAMETERS_CONSTANTS Set up the parameters for four different Q-learning models
%   based on laboratory and online experiments.
%
%   QL_PARAM = QL_parameters_constants() returns a structure QL_PARAM that contains
%   four different Q-learning models with different parameter sets. Two of these models are based on
%   parameters estimated from a previous study (Erev et al., 2010; Shteingart, Neiman, & Loewenstein, 2013)
%   that was conducted on humans in the laboratory. The parameters of the two other models were estimated
%   from a dataset of online operant learning experiments. Moreover, in two models, the parameters were
%   fitted assuming that a single set of parameters describes all subjects. In the two other models,
%   the idiosyncratic parameters of each subject were estimated.
%
%   QL_PARAM structure:
%   The structure contains four substructures, one for each model, each with
%   three fields for the parameters ETA, BETA, and EPSILON.
%   ETA - learning rate, BETA - inverse temperature parameter, EPSILON - exploration parameter,

BETA_MAX = 500; % Maximum allowed beta value

% Nested function to constrain the beta value to be less than or equal to BETA_MAX
    function constrained_beta = constrain_beta(beta)
        constrained_beta = beta;
        constrained_beta(beta >= BETA_MAX) = BETA_MAX;
